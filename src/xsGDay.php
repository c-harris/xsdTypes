/**
 * The type xsd:gDay represents a day that recurs every month. The letter g signifies "Gregorian." xsd:gDay can be
 * used to say, for example, that checks are paid on the 5th of each month. To represent a duration of days, use
 * the duration type instead. The format of gDay is ---DD.
 *
 * An optional time zone expression may be added at the end of the value. The letter Z is used to indicate Coordinated
 * Universal Time (UTC). All other time zones are represented by their difference from Coordinated Universal Time in
 *
 * the format +hh:mm, or -hh:mm. These values may range from -14:00 to 14:00. For example, US Eastern Standard Time,
 * which is five hours behind UTC, is represented as -05:00. If no time zone value is present, it is considered
 * unknown; it is not assumed to be UTC.
