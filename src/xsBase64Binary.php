/**
 * The type xsd:base64Binary represents binary data as a sequence of binary octets.  It uses base64 encoding, as
 * described in RFC 2045.  The following rules apply to xsd:base64Binary values:.
 *
 * - The following characters are allowed: the letters A to Z (upper and lower case), digits 0 through 9, the plus sign
 *     ("+"), the slash ("/"), the equals sign ("=") and XML whitespace characters.
 * - XML whitespace characters may appear anywhere in the value.
 * - The number of non-whitespace characters must be divisible by 4.
 * - Equals signs may only appear at the end of the value, and there may be zero, one or two of them.  If there are two
 *      equals signs, they must be preceded by one of the following characters: AQgw.  If there is only one equals sign,
 *      it must be preceded by one of the following characters: AEIMQUYcgkosw048.  In either case, there may be
 *      whitespace in between the necessary characters and the equals sign(s).
