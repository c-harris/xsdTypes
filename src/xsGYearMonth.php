/**
 * The type xsd:gYearMonth represents a specific month of a specific year. The letter g signifies "Gregorian." The
 * format of xsd:gYearMonth is CCYY-MM. No left truncation is allowed on either part. To represents years later than
 * 9999, additional digits can be added to the left of the year value. To represent years before 0001,
 * a preceding minus sign ("-") is permitted.
 *
 * An optional time zone expression may be added at the end of the value. The letter Z is used to indicate Coordinated
 * Universal Time (UTC). All other time zones are represented by their difference from Coordinated Universal Time in
 * the format +hh:mm, or -hh:mm. These values may range from -14:00 to 14:00. For example, US Eastern Standard Time,
 * which is five hours behind UTC, is represented as -05:00. If no time zone value is present, it is considered
 * unknown; it is not assumed to be UTC.
