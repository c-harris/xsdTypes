 * The type xsd:gMonthDay represents a specific day that recurs every year. The letter g signifies "Gregorian."
 * xsd:gMonthDay can be used to say, for example, that your birthday is on the 14th of April every year. The format
 * of xsd:gMonthDay is --MM-DD.
 *
 * An optional time zone expression may be added at the end of the value. The letter Z is used to indicate Coordinated
 * Universal Time (UTC). All other time zones are represented by their difference from Coordinated Universal Time in
 * the format +hh:mm, or -hh:mm. These values may range from -14:00 to 14:00. For example, US Eastern Standard Time,
 * which is five hours behind UTC, is represented as -05:00. If no time zone value is present, it is considered
 * unknown; it is not assumed to be UTC.
